This is Team Convolution's final model for the Term project.

Instruction on how to run the model:
	1. Put the test dataset (both the image set and label set) to where the "final" folder is.

	2. change the image dataset to name: "test_X.npy".

	3. change the label dataset to name: "test_Y.npy".

	4. Assume both dataset has the same data structure as the provided validation set.

	5. Use "python train.py" to run the program.

	6. Training will be skipped if there is a ckpt/checkpoint file exist.  
	
	7. The "result" parameter inside the try-loop is the actual labels generated by our model.
	   It has a structure of [[[digit1][digit2]],[],[]]..
